Instruction on the Right to Withdraw:

The Participant may retract his submission for the conclusion of a contract (regarding participation in the game ) as well as any order for chargeable functions and applications, in text form (e.g. by letter, telefax, email) within two weeks. The Participant does not have to give any explanation for this. This two-week time limit starts when the Participant has received this instruction on his right to retract in written form, but not before the conclusion of the contract and not before Bytro Labs has fulfilled its informational obligations under Sect. 312c (2) 1 BGB, Sect. 1 (1), (2), (4) BGB-InfoV as well as its obligations under Sect. 312e (1) 1 BGB, Sect. (3) BGB-InfoV. It is sufficient to send the retraction within the Time Limit.

Any obligations regarding the payment of compensation must be fulfilled within 30 days. This time limit starts for the Participant with the sending of the retraction notice, for Bytro Labs with its receipt.

§ 7 Prices and Payment Conditions; Payment dates

7.1 Upon payment of a fee, the Participant will be granted the opportunity to obtain additional services which are not available in the basic version of the game.

Depending on their function, such additional services may be purchased either by a one-off payment or by paying a subscription fee. These additional services with costs allow the Participant to use certain additional functions for a specified time and in accordance with the game ’s game rules. Since the game will be developed and enhanced from time to time, Bytro Labs reserves its rights to offer new additional services or to stop offering certain additional services or to offer certain additional services in the basic version of the game. In the event that the Participant has made payments for additional services for a period of time in the future, and cannot make use of these, because they are no longer offered and/or are offered in the free basic version of the game as well, Bytro Labs will at the choice of the Participant offer other additional services as a substitute or refund the Participant on a pro rata basis. In the aforementioned cases, the Participant has the right to terminate the contract with immediate effect. Any other claims of the Participant are excluded.

7.3 Bytro Labs is entitled to lower its prices permanently or temporarily and to permanently or temporarily offer new products, services or invoicing methods. Bytro Labs is further entitled to change the prices at any time with six weeks prior written notice or by informing the Participant via email to the email address provided by the Participant. If the Participant does not object to the price changes within six weeks of being informed of the price change, the new price will become effective. The contractual relationship will then continue with the new conditions / prices. Bytro Labs will inform the Participant about the potential to object and the legal consequences, especially the legal consequences arising from a failure to object, when notifying the Participant about the changes. If the Participant objects in time, each party may terminate the contract with one month’s prior notice. Until termination, the former tariffs and prices will remain in effect.

Bytro Labs shall have the right to debit these cancellation fees and costs, along with the original fees, from the Participant’s account. If payment of the fees is made through debit or through credit cards and reversal debits occur, Bytro Labs charges a service fee of EUR 9,00 per debit / credit card transaction plus banking fees, unless the Participant proves that no damage or only a substantially lower damage has been caused.

7.6  The Participant may only offset if he has a claim against Bytro Labs which Bytro Labs has not disputed or which has been declared legally binding by a court decision. The Participant may only withhold payment if he has a claim against Bytro Labs which has its origin in the same contractual relation. The Participant is not entitled to assign his claims against Bytro Labs to a third party.

§ 8 Term and Termination

8.1  Any contracts between the Participant and Bytro Labs are entered into for an unlimited period of time, unless otherwise agreed. Where the contract has been entered into for an unlimited period of time, both Parties may terminate the contract with immediate effect at any time.

8.2  In the event that the contract regarding the use or the provision of additional services has been agreed upon by means of a subscription, the subscription automatically renews for the same period of time, unless the subscription has been terminated with a period of 15 working days, effective upon the end of the term.

8.3 The right of both Parties to terminate the contract for cause remains unaffected by the aforementioned provisions. In the event that Bytro Labs is responsible for the extraordinary termination of the contract, the Participant will be reimbursed for any payments he may have made in respect of the period after the termination takes effect, on a pro rata basis. The Participant does not have any other claims, unless otherwise provided in these ToS.

8.4 Bytro Labs may in particular terminate the contract for cause if:

The Participant is late in paying fees of at least EUR 10,00 despite two reminders

The Participant culpably breaches any legal rule, these ToS and/or specific rules for the use of additional services, and such breach remains uncured in identical or similar form, despite written notice

8.5 In case of severe breaches, the contract may be terminated without prior written notice. A severe breach is a breach which makes it unreasonable for Bytro Labs to remain bound by the contract and includes, but is not limited to:

a The Participant breaches criminal law

b The Participant breaches the prohibition of multi-accounts (see above §4, para 4.3)

c The Participant breaches the prohibition of non-authorized scripts (see above §6, para 6.1)

d The Participant provides incorrect information upon registration (see §4) or upon payment for functions and applications with costs (see §7).

8.6.  Each termination has to be in writing in order to be effective; email is sufficient to comply with the written form requirement. Extraordinary termination of the contract must state the reasons for termination.

§ 9 Copyright

The Participant remains the owner of all rights he may have in the content he makes available in the game. By making content available on the the game platform, the Participant grants Bytro Lab free of charge a non-exclusive license to publicly display, reproduce and make publicly available, worldwide, such content on the the game platform. Bytro Lab is not granted any further rights to use the content which is made available by the Participant. The license is terminated if the Participant deletes the content he generated from the the game platform.

§ 10 Data Protection

Bytro Labs is entitled to store personal data electronically in order to monitor compliance with the game rules, these ToS and applicable law. Further, personal data may be collected, processed and used for the purposes of the implementation of the contract, including billing. Also IP addresses and data regarding the time and type of use of the Website, the email address which the Participant has provided in the registration form and further data which the Participant has provided in his profile, will be stored. Furthermore, Bytro Labs is entitled to use personal data of Participants within the scope of what is permissible by law without further consent of the Participant, in order to provide the Participant with product information regarding products of Bytro Labs, if the Participant has not objected to such use of his data. The Participant may object at any time.

For the complete Bytro Labs Privacy Policy, see here.

§ 11 Liability for Content

Regarding communication between Participants, the game serves as a platform via which the Participants may communicate with each other. The Participants are solely responsible for the content of such communication and for further content which is made available on the Internet site by the Participants. Bytro Labs is not responsible for any content which is pornographic, racist, offensive or otherwise of an illegal nature, which has been made available on the platform or otherwise on the Internet site of the game by Participants. The same applies to content which infringes third party rights in any other way. Any breach may lead to the immediate deletion and/or blocking of the relevant content and/or the Account of the Participant and to the exclusion of the Participant from the game by termination of the contract with the Participant. Bytro Labs is not responsible for the content of other third-party sites which can be accessed via links from the game ’s site. Bytro Labs does not control any of these sites and expressly dissociates itself from their content.

§ 12 Claims based on defects; Limitation of Liability

12.1  Bytro Labs only offers and provides the game in its then current version. The Participant cannot claim that a certain condition or functional status of the game and/or additional services are maintained or achieved. The Participant is aware that the game and/or the additional services  – like any other software – can never be completely free of errors. Therefore, the game and/or the additional services can only be considered to be defective if usability is affected severely and for a prolonged period.

12.2 The Participant shall document any significant defect in the game or other services or deliveries of Bytro Labs; he shall report them in writing, along with a log of the error messages displayed. Before reporting a potential error, the Participant shall consult the instructions and other troubleshooting tools provided by Bytro Labs (especially frequently asked questions lists or forums for troubleshooting). The Participants shall use their best efforts to support Bytro Labs in any attempts to eliminate errors.

12.3 The Participants will notify Bytro Labs of any defects in writing, without undue delay, upon discovery. Apparent defects of goods – including virtual goods – must be reported to Bytro Labs in writing within two weeks of receipt of the goods. The time limit will be met if the report is sent within this period. Any defects must be reported without undue delay upon discovery. If no notice has been given within the time limit, all claims based on such defects shall forfeit. For the Participant’s own protection and for evidence reasons, the Participant is advised to send such reports in writing (e.g. by telefax, letter or Email) to Bytro Labs.

12.4 Bytro Labs is not liable for any defects which are caused by external events,  handling errors by the Participant, force majeure or by manipulations which are not carried out by Bytro Labs or which cannot be attributed to Bytro Labs.

12.5 Bytro Labs does not assume any warranties, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.

12.6 Bytro Labs is not liable for damages unless they are caused intentionally or by gross negligence. Bytro Labs are liable for advice given only as far as the advice concerned the game directly.

12.7 The aforementioned limitations in 12.6 do not apply to the liability for personal injury of life, body and health. They do not apply in the event that the damage is the result of a breach of a guarantee. They do not apply in respect of the breach of a primary obligation (i.e. a contractual duty, the adherence to which is of special importance to the fulfilment of the contractual objective and on which the client, as a party to this contract, may legitimately rely) or an essential obligation. Bytro Labs’ liability according to the product liability laws and Sect. 44 a TKG remain unaffected.

12.8 Liability for breach of an essential obligation is limited to the damage which could reasonably have been foreseen. The damage which could have been foreseen is limited to EUR 20,00 per Account.

12.9 The aforementioned limitations of liability also apply for the personal liability of staff, employees, assistants, vicarious agents, contributors, representatives, organs, shareholders of Bytro Labs and their members.

§ 13 Further Duties and Obligations of Participants

13.1 The Participant is aware that he uses the game together with many other Participants and communicates with different Participants when using the additional services. In order to achieve an enjoyable gaming experience, it is necessary to adhere to the rules of the game. The Participants accept the rules of the game and the ToS as binding. The Participants will follow Bytro Lab’s instructions which will be provided by the game supervisor. Additionally, the Participants will refrain from any conduct which may interfere with the operation of the game and/or the additional services and which may disturb an enjoyable gaming experience.

13.2 The Participants must not use the game for commercial or illegal purposes.

13.3 Bytro Labs is not responsible for any damage or loss of data on the local computer of the Participant which results from the installation of software which was not provided by Bytro Labs.

13.4 The Participant is obliged to keep all access data for the game (login, passwords etc.) strictly confidential. He will promptly inform Bytro Labs if he finds out or suspects that an unauthorised third person is in possession of his access data. The Participant must not use the Account or access data of another Participant. The Participant is aware that in the event that a third party uses the game with his access data, through his own fault, the Participant is liable for the fees and for damages. All access through a Participant’s access data shall be considered as an access by that particular Participant himself. Bytro Labs points out that passwords should regularly be changed for security reasons.

13.5 In the event that Bytro Labs has reason to believe that an unauthorised third party is in possession of access data, Bytro Labs may, without assuming any responsibility to do so, and always acting at its sole discretion, change the access data without prior notice or block the respective Account. Bytro Labs will promptly inform the rightful Participant and will, upon request, communicate the new access data to him without undue delay. The Participant cannot claim to have his initial access data restored.

13.6 Bytro Labs protects its systems against viruses. However, the Participant acknowledges that virus can never be completely ruled out. The Participant is aware that unauthorised third parties may send emails under the name of Bytro Labs, without Bytro Lab’s knowledge or consent, and such emails may contain viruses, so-called spyware or links to websites which, in turn, contain viruses or spyware. Bytro Lab cannot prevent such behaviour. The Participant will, therefore, check all incoming mail sent by or under the name of Bytro Labs, for viruses before opening them. This also applies to emails sent by other Participants.

13.7 Bytro Labs will usually, unless otherwise provided in these ToS or other agreements between the Participant and Bytro Labs, communicate with the Participant via email. The Participant shall make sure that he receives all emails sent by Bytro Labs to the address submitted to Bytro Labs in the registration form or at a later date. In particular, he will configure the spam filter accordingly and regularly check this address for incoming mail. Bytro Labs may choose any other appropriate means of communication.

§ 14 Changes to these ToS

14.1 Bytro Labs reserves the right to make changes to these ToS for the future, if this should prove necessary and if the Participant is not disadvantaged contrary to good faith.

14.2 The Participant will be notified of the changes to the ToS at least two weeks before the changes become effective, in appropriate written form. Notification will usually take place upon the next log-in of the Participant.

14.3 The Participant can object to a change or amendment of the ToS within one month of being notified thereof. If the Participant objects in time, each party may terminate the contract by giving one month’s notice. Further termination rights remain unaffected. Payment made for services after the termination takes effect will be reimbursed on a pro rata basis. If the Participant fails to object to the changes to the ToS within one month of being notified, the change or amendment made to the ToS will become effective regarding the respective Participant.

§ 15 Place of Jurisdiction / Applicable Law / Written Form

15.1 The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany apply to these ToS and any and all contracts concluded subject to these ToS, as well as any claims arising therefrom. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is excluded.

15.2 Should any provision of these ToS be held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then this shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

15.3 Any changes and amendments to the contract between Bytro Labs and the Participant and to any additional agreements, must be in writing. Any change to the written form requirement must also be in writing.

III. General information on data processing

1. Scope of personal data processing

As a rule, we only collect personal data that you share when making use of the services while logging in or registering and when utilizing fee-based services, as needed. Personal data is considered data that includes information on personal or factual circumstances. When logging in and registering as a user to our website, you merely need to provide an email address and/or user name and/or password.The password is encrypted and does not allow any conclusion to be made on the actual password at any time. Within the scope of carrying out the user contract concluded, in particular your chosen fee-based services, additional data, such as complete name, address, banking details, credit card numbers, etc. may be required. Additionally, when processing your requests or to provide you with support, it is sometimes required to ask you for personal data such as name, address, email address, and telephone number. We also collect data as part of voluntary participation in inquiries and surveys. We submit personal data only to cooperating companies or external service providers, provided this is legally required or permitted, in particular in performance of a contract, to process payments, as well as to protect other users or defend against dangers for national or public security, or to prosecute criminal offenses. Your interests worthy of protection are considered in pursuance with statutory data protection regulations. In the event of a default in payment, we hereby reserve the right to commission a collection agency or an attorney to collect the payment due, as needed, and to provide the necessary data within this context. We treat all of this data in a confidential manner and in consideration of statutory data protection regulations. As a rule, we do not provide such information to third parties without your permission, unless it is required to execute and settle the contract, to process your request, or to provide you with support, or permitted according to statutory data protection regulations.

2. Legal basis for processing personal data

If we receive the consent of the person concerned to process personal data, Art. 6 Para. 1 a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for processing personal data. When processing personal data that is required to perform a contract whose contractual party is the person concerned, Art. 6 Para. 1 b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing processes that are required to carry out pre-contractual measures. If personal data must be processed to comply with a legal requirement to which our company is subject, Art. 6 Para. 1 c GDPR serves as the legal basis. In the event that the vital interests of the person concerned or another natural person make it necessary to process personal data, Art. 6 Para. 1 d GDPR serves as the legal basis. If processing is required to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, and if the interests, basic rights, and basic freedoms of the party concerned do not prevail over the previously stated interest, Art. 6 Para. 1 f GDPR serves as the legal basis.

3. Purpose of processing personal data

We collect and process data in order to enable you to use our services. This also includes processing for the purpose of data security and the stability and operational security of our system as well as accounting purposes. We process data in order to provide you assistance when you submit support inquiries. Data is also processed in order to discover and prevent the improper use of multiple accounts, e.g. fraudulent purposes. Data is processed in order to acquire new customers and distribute promotional material that we believe correlates with your interests.

4. Data erasure and storage duration

The personal data of the person concerned is erased or locked as soon as there is no longer a reason to store it. Data may also be stored if required by European or national lawmakers in Union directives, laws, or other regulation to which the responsible party is subject. Data may also be stored or erased after the storage period stipulated by the specified standards expires, unless the continued storage of the data is required to conclude or perform a contract.

5. Data security

We endeavor to take reasonable precautions in order to prevent unauthorized access to your personal data as well as unauthorized use or falsification of this data and to minimize the associated risks. Nevertheless, providing personal data, whether in person, on the telephone, or via the internet, is always associated with risks and no technical system is completely free of the possibility of manipulation or sabotage. We process the data collected from you in accordance with German and European data protection law. All employees are required to protect data privacy and comply with data protection regulation, and are trained accordingly. For payment purposes, your data is transmitted using the SSL process and encrypted.

 

IV. Provision of services and creation of log files

1. Description and scope of data processing

Whenever our services are solicited, our system automatically collects data and information on the visiting computer system. The following data is collected during this:

Internet protocol
IP address
URL of the referring website from which the file was requested
Date and time of access
Browser type and operating system as well as hardware information
The site you visited
Quantity of data transmitted
Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)
Duration and frequency of use
Available IDs of third parties (such as Google Play ID, Facebook ID, etc.) in order to enable cross-device use
The data is also stored in the log files of our system.

2. Legal basis for data processing

Art. 6 Para. 1 f GDPR is the legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files.

3. Purpose of data processing

Temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary in order to deliver services to the computer of the user. To do so, the IP address of the user must be stored for the duration of the session. Data is stored in log files in order to ensure the functionality of the services. Additionally, the data also serves to optimize the services and to ensure the security of our IT systems. Data is stored over the duration of the session for purposes of combating fraud (e.g. payment fraud, violation of the rules of play through the use of multiple accounts by the same person) and for the purposes of IT security (e.g. protection against DDoS attacks). Otherwise, the data is stored merely for purposes of statistical evaluation. In order to monitor compliance with the rules of use and rules of play, we reserve the right to store IP addresses and log files for a certain period of time after our services are utilized. In particular, this procedure serves to avoid certain cases of misuse or to resolve them and be able to forward the data in individual cases to investigative authorities or to rectify bugs.   Additionally, any evaluation of data is carried out in an anonymous manner wherever possible. After this period ends, the IP address and log files are completely erased, unless there exist mandatory statutory storage requirements or concrete criminal or abuse proceedings. For these purposes, our legitimate and overriding interest is to process data in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 f GDPR.

4. Duration of storage

The data is erased as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.

5. Option to object and erase

Data collection to provide services and data storage in log files is absolutely required in order to ensure the uninterrupted provision of services. As a consequence, the user has no option to object.

 

V. Push notifications

1. Description and scope of data processing

We can send push notifications to your device in order to share with you updates on services, news, and other relevant messages.

2. Legal basis for data processing

The legal basis for processing data is Art. 6 Para. 1 b GDPR if a contract exists.

3. Option to object and erase

You can prevent your data from being processed by applying the respective settings to your system. Please refer to the documentation of the system you use.

 

VI. Contact form and email, in-game support

1. Description and scope of data processing

There is a contact form on our website which can be used to contact us electronically. If a user makes use of this option, the data submitted into the input form will be sent to us and stored. This data is:

Email
Type of request
User name
Subject
Question/problem
Browser, hardware, and operating system data
Alternatively, we can be contacted using the email provided. In this case, the personal data of the user is saved with the email used to send it. Alternatively, you can also send inquiries to us within the game. In this context, no data is forwarded to third parties. The data is used exclusively to process the inquiry.

2. Legal basis for data processing

The legal basis for processing data is Art. 6 Para.1 a GDPR if the user has provided consent. The legal basis for processing data, that is submitted when an email is sent, is Art. 6 Para. 1 f GDPR. If the email is intended to conclude a contract, the further legal basis for processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 b GDPR.

3. Purpose of data processing

We process personal data from the input form solely to process communication. In the event that contact is made via email, there is also the required legitimate interest to process the data here. The other data processed during the submission process serves to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our IT systems.

4. Duration of storage

The data is erased as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. The data is stored for twelve months for the purposes of combating fraud and improving support.

5. Option to object and erase

The user has the option, at any time, to withdraw his consent to process the personal data. If the user contacts us, he can object to the storage of his personal data at any time. In such an event, the conversation cannot continue. All personal data, that was stored when contact was made, is erased in this case.

Conversion tracking cookies. In order to provide our users with the best possible gaming experience, we strive to constantly add new players to our games. In the process of determining and driving marketing measures, we use conversion tracking. In doing so, a marketing partner records, with our help, when a user completes a registration or a predefined action in the game. This occurs either via direct automated contact with the server of the marketing partner or through an intermediary service provider. The data that we transfer is limited to what is most necessary. When starting to use our services, the user is informed about the use of cookies. If the user does not wish for our cookies to be stored on his display device, would like to delete a stored cookie, or would like to be informed about the storage of such, the user can configure his browser or mobile end device accordingly. The details of how these are applied can be found using the help information of the browser. We would like to explicitly state that, in this case, not all functions of the services can be used in their entirety. If you access our services via third parties, it may be the case that they use cookies. We have no influence on this. Please note the data protection guidelines of these third parties.

2. Legal basis for data processing

For these purposes, we also have a legitimate interest in the processing of personal data according to Art. 6 Para. 1 f GDPR. Additionally, we have a legitimate interest in directing advertising in our services. We have an interest in finding new customers. In order to achieve this, our advertising partners must use cookies.

IX. Rights of the person concerned

If we process your personal data, you are the person concerned in the sense of the GDPR, and you have the following rights with respect to the responsible party.

1. Right of access

You can request from the responsible party a confirmation of whether personal data that concerns you is processed by us. If such processing occurs, you can request the following information from the responsible party:

The purposes for which the personal data is processed;
The categories of personal data that is processed;
The recipient or categories of recipients to which the personal data that concerns you was submitted or not submitted;
The planned duration of storage of the personal data concerning you, or, if concrete information on this is not available, the criteria for determining the storage duration;
The existence of a right to disclose or erase the personal data concerning you, a right to limit processing on the part of the responsible party, or a right to object to this processing;
The existence of a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
All available information on the source of the data if the personal data is not collected for the person concerned;
The existence of an automated decision making process including profiling in accordance with Art. 22 Para. 1 and 4 GDPR and, at least in these cases, detailed information on the logic involved as well as the scope and the desired effects of such processing for the person concerned.
You have the right to request information on whether the personal data concerning you is sent to a third country or an international organization. In this context, you can request suitable guarantees pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR in connection with the transfer.

2. Right to rectification

You have the right to rectification and/or completion, with respect to the responsible party, provided that the processed personal data concerning you is incorrect or incomplete. The responsible party must make the rectification without delay.

3. Right to limit processing

Under the following conditions, you can request a limit to the processing of the personal data concerning you:

If you contest the correctness of the personal data concerning you for a duration of time that enables the responsible party to verify the correctness of the personal data;
The processing is illegal and you refuse erasure of the personal data and instead request a limitation of the use of the personal data;
The responsible party no longer requires the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you require it to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims, or
If you have submitted the objection to processing according to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR and it is not yet certain whether the legitimate concerns of the responsible party prevail over your concerns.
If the processing of the personal data concerning you was limited, this data, except for its storage, may only be processed with your consent or to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims, or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the Union or a member state. If processing was limited according to the above conditions, you will be informed by the responsible party before the limitation is applied.

4. Right to erasure

We offer the option to independently delete or correct your own personal data in game. If you are logged in to your account, you can delete your personal data in the settings of your user account.

a) Obligation to erase

You can request that the responsible party immediately erase the personal data concerning you, provided one of the following reasons applies:

The personal data concerning you is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected or processed in another manner.
You withdraw your consent upon which processing pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 a or Art. 9 Para. 2 a DSGVO is based, and there is no other legal basis for processing.
You submit an objection to processing pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR and there exist no superordinate legitimate reasons for processing, or you submit an objection to processing pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 2 GDPR.
The personal data concerning you was processed illegally.
The erasure of the personal data concerning you is required to comply with a legal requirement according to Union law or the law of a member state to which the responsible party is subject.
The personal data concerning you was collected in regard to services offered by the information company in accordance with Art. 8 Para. 1 GDPR.
b) Information to third parties

If the responsible party published the personal data concerning you and is required to erase such according to Art. 17 Para. 1 GDPR, said party will take suitable measures, also of a technical nature and in consideration of available technology and implementation costs, to inform data processors processing the personal data that you, as the person concerned, have requested the erasure of all links to this personal data or copies or replications of this personal data.

c) Exceptions

There is no right of erasure if processing is required to exercise the right of free expression and information;

To comply with a legal obligation to which the responsible party is subject according to Union law or that of a member state for processing purposes, or to perform a task that is in the public interest or in the practice of public authority conferred to the responsible party;
For reasons of public interest in the area of public health according to Art. 9 Para. 2 h and i as well as Art. 9 Para. 3 GDPR;
For archiving purposes, scientific or historic research purposes, or for statistical purposes in the public interest according to Art. 89 Para. 1 GDPR, provided that the right specified in section a) temporarily makes the achievement of the goals of processing impossible or severely limits such, or
To assert, exercise, or defend legal claims.
5. Right to information

If you have asserted the right to information on, erasure, or limitation of processing with respect to the responsible party, said party is required to share this rectification or erasure of the data or limitation of processing with all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you was published, unless this proves to be impossible or is associated with excessive cost. You have the right to information on these recipients from the responsible party.

6. Right to data transferability

You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you provided to the responsible party, in a structured, standard, and machine-readable format. Additionally, you have the right to transfer this data to another responsible party without obstruction on the part of the responsible party, to which the personal data was provided,

provided that processing occurs based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 a GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 a GDPR or a contract pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 b GDPR,
and the processing is carried out using automatic processes.
When exercising this right, you also have the right to ensure that the personal data concerning you is transferred directly from one responsible party to another responsible party, provided this is technically feasible. The freedom and rights of others may not be affected by this. The right of data transferability does not apply for processing personal data that is required to carry out a task that is in the public interest or in the practice of public authority conferred to the responsible party;

7. Right to object

You have the right, for reasons relating to your particular situation, to submit at any time objection to processing of the personal data concerning you which is conducted based on Art. 6 Para. 1 e or f GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these conditions. The responsible party no longer processes the personal data concerning you, unless said party can provide evidence of compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing that prevail over your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims. If the personal data concerning you is processed in order to pursue direct advertising, you have the right to submit at any time objection to processing of the personal data concerning you for the purposes of such advertising; this also applies to profiling, provided it is in connection with direct advertising. If you object to processing for the purpose of direct advertising, the personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for these purposes. Regardless of Directive 2002/58/EC, you have the option, in connection with the use of services of the information company, of exercising your right to object using an automated process that uses technical specifications.

8. Right to withdraw data protection declarations of consent

You have the right to withdraw your declaration of consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the legality of the processing conducted on the basis of the consent up to the date of the withdrawal.

9. Automated decision in individual cases including profiling

You have the right not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which will have legal effect or similarly affect you in a similar manner. This does not apply if the decision

a) is required to conclude or carry out a contract between you and the responsible party,

b) is permissible on the basis of Union or member state law to which the responsible party is subject, and that legislation contains suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests, or

c) is made with your explicit consent.

However, these decisions must not be based on special categories of personal data under Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR, provided that Art. 9 Para. 2 a or g does not apply, and reasonable measures have been taken to protect your rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests. With respect to the situations mentioned in (a) and (c), the responsible party shall take appropriate measures to protect your rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests, including at least the right to obtain the intervention of a person on the part of the responsible party to express his own position and challenge the decision.

10. Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial legal remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of your place of residence or employment or the place of the alleged infringement, if you believe that the processing of the personal data concerning you violates the GDPR. The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been submitted shall inform the complainant of the status and results of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article 78 of the GDPR</string>
